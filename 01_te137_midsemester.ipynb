    "This is your mid-semester project. You can work on this project in two ways.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### You can work with a partner\n",
    "Only one partner (max two per group) is allowed. Each person in the group is expected to contribute equally to project. The team needs to do work equivalent to 2 individuals. We will be strict in grading criteria for groups. The team also needs to work hard to find good answers for Part 1 and Part 7. A post questionaire may be given to assess each person contribution. Each person in the team MUST submit a copy of the project. You MUST complete this survey by 11/10 to work as a team <a href=\"https://forms.gle/2qcog71UqQsgovCB8\">CLICK HERE TO FILL THE SURVEY </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You can work by yourself\n",
    "If you work by yourself, you have two parts optional. Part 1 and Part 7. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Project Purpose    \n",
    " \n",
    "The goal of this mid-semester project is to work with Twitter API to analyze tweets from a person, and in this case, Former President Donald Trump.  @RealDonaldTrump tweets provide a great opportunity to understand how online media can be used to communicate over the traditional media. In fact, social media post are so influential, now the traditional media spends considerable amount of time discussing social media posts. Tweets from people such as Donald Trump and Elon Musk have become so consequential, they can move the stock market on short term and get network TV to debate and discuss hours and hours about what Trump or Musk meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope this project will be fun as we can analyze range of emotions, hope, controversy, vagueness that are part of Trump tweets. We are interested in seeing what conclusions you can draw from US Presidents tweets. \n",
    "* DISCLAIMER: This project is not designed with any bias in mind. Note that we could pick any person (Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump or Elon Musk) or anyone else to do the same analysis. We hope your analysis is objective, independent of any political bias you may have. As Data Scientists, it is our responsiblity to do independent analysis of the data we try to understand. You should follow data and interpret w/o any bias.\n"

Explain that you are doing this for a class at Rutgers University and that you don't know exactly what you're building yet and just need the account to get started.

    "The Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a tool generally used to identify patterns and to reduce the number of variables you have to consider in your analysis. For example, if you have data with 200 columns, it may be that a significant amount of the variance in your data can be explained by just 100 principal components. In the PCA, the first component is chosen in such a way that has the largest variance, subsequent components are orthogonal and continue covering as much variance as possible. In this way, the PCA samples as much of the variability in the data set with the first few components. Mathematically, each component is a linear combination of all the input parameters times coefficients specific for that component. These coefficients, or loading factors, are constrained such that the sum of the squares of them are equal to 1. As such, the loading factors serve as weights describing how strongly certain parameters contribute to the specific principal component. Parameters with large values of positive or negative loading factors are correlated with each other, which can serve to identify trends in your data."
